# GitLab

Connect the [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=\_blank} bot to your GitLab projects to automatically review every merge request. The setup uses a token-based integration. Provide a GitLab access token, select the projects to monitor, and the bot begins reviewing your merge requests.

Once connected, the bot reviews every new merge request and every new commit pushed to an open merge request. No additional configuration is needed.

!!! tip "Use PR Reviews as your last line of defense"
    For the best results, use kluster in your [IDE](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/ide-reviews/ai-generated-code/automatic-reviews/) or [CLI](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/cli/quickstart/) during development. Catching issues early reduces review cycles and keeps changes clean. PR Reviews then acts as a safety net for anything missed before merging.
## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- A [kluster.ai](https://platform.kluster.ai/signup){target=\_blank} account.
- A GitLab account with at least **Developer** access to the projects you want to review.
- A GitLab access token with the `api` scope. See [Create an access token](#create-an-access-token) for instructions.

## Create an access token

The kluster.ai bot requires a GitLab access token with the `api` scope to read merge requests and post review comments.

!!! tip "Use a dedicated service account"
    Reviews posted by the bot are attributed to the token owner. To avoid reviews appearing under a personal account, create a dedicated GitLab service account for kluster and generate the token from that account.

=== "Personal access token"

    1. Sign in to the GitLab account that will be associated with the kluster.ai bot reviews.
    2. Open the [Personal access tokens](https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/personal_access_tokens){target=\_blank} page and click **Add new token**.
    3. Enter a descriptive name (for example, "kluster.ai PR Reviews"), set an expiration date, and select the following scopes: `api`, `read_api`, and `read_user`.
    4. Click **Generate token**, then copy the token immediately. The token value is only displayed once and cannot be retrieved later.

=== "Group access token"

    Group access tokens are available on GitLab Premium or Ultimate. They are scoped to a specific group and automatically create a bot user for reviews.

    1. Navigate to the group, then go to **Settings > Access Tokens**.
    2. Create a token with the `api` scope and **Developer** access.

    Each group requires its own token.

## Connect GitLab

You can set up the GitLab integration from the [PR Reviews](https://platform.kluster.ai/pr-bot-installation){target=\_blank} page on the kluster.ai platform.

1. Navigate to [PR Reviews](https://platform.kluster.ai/pr-bot-installation){target=\_blank} in the kluster.ai platform. The PR Bot Installation page displays the available integrations, including GitLab. Click **Connect GitLab**.

2. A dialog appears prompting you to enter your GitLab API token. Enter your credentials and click **Save & Install**.

3. After the credentials are validated, a message confirms the GitLab integration as **Installed** and lists the registered workspaces. By default, kluster has access to all groups associated with the API token owner.

## What happens after setup

Once the integration is connected, the kluster.ai bot begins reviewing merge requests automatically. No further action is required.

### On new merge requests

When a merge request is opened, the bot triggers a pipeline that analyzes all changes using ultra-deep analysis. Once the pipeline completes, the bot posts its feedback:

- A **summary comment** titled **kluster.ai PR Review Summary**, which includes a description of the changes, the review result (All Clear or a list of detected issues), and a prior review warning if no IDE or CLI reviews were performed on the branch.

    ![Example of a kluster.ai PR Review Summary comment on a GitLab merge request](/kluster-mkdocs/images/code-reviews/pr-reviews/pr-reviews-gitlab-03.webp)

- **Inline comments** on specific lines where issues were found. Each inline comment includes a severity badge (for example, `security · critical`), a description, a detailed explanation, a recommended action, and quick issue actions to ignore the finding or copy an AI prompt for fixing it.

    When clicking **Ignore issue** or **Copy AI prompt**, you are taken to the kluster.ai platform. From there, you can access the ignore menu to dismiss the finding or view the prompt needed to feed an AI agent for fixing the issue, which is automatically copied to your clipboard.

!!! warning "Bot comments appear under the token owner's name"
    In GitLab, the bot's comments are attributed to the user who created the access token. This is why a dedicated service account is recommended in the [Create an access token](#create-an-access-token) section.

### On new commits

When new commits are pushed to an open merge request, the bot re-runs its analysis on the updated changes and updates its comments accordingly.

### Prior review detection

If kluster was used during development on the branch (via IDE or CLI), the bot's summary comment includes review statistics, such as the number of reviews performed, issues found, and issues left unfixed. If no prior reviews were detected, the bot includes a note encouraging earlier use of kluster in the development workflow.
