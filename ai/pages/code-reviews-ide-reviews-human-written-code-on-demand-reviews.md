# On-demand reviews 

With [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=\_blank}, you can trigger reviews three ways: right-click any selection, use hint buttons, or scan uncommitted changes.

!!! tip "Exclude files with .klusterignore"
    If there are files or folders you never want kluster.ai to review (generated code, build output, vendored dependencies), add them to a [`.klusterignore`](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/configuration/klusterignore/) file. On-demand IDE reviews respect `.klusterignore`.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- **A kluster.ai account**: Sign up on the [kluster.ai platform](https://platform.kluster.ai/signup){target=\_blank} if you don't have one.
- **kluster.ai installed in your IDE**: Follow the [Installation guide](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/get-started/installation/) to set it up in your favourite IDE.

## How on-demand reviews work

1.  **You write code**: Work in your editor as usual.
2.  **You trigger review**: Right-click, use a hint button, or click in the sidebar.
3.  **kluster.ai analyzes**: Results appear with issues and suggested fixes.

## Sidebar review

Open the kluster.ai extension to access the **On-Demand Review** section in the sidebar. Use the **Mode** dropdown to choose what to review:

- **Review current file**: Verifies only the file currently open in the editor.
- **Review uncommitted changes**: Verifies all uncommitted changes across multiple files.
- **Review all branch changes**: Verifies all changes compared against the selected base branch.

Then choose your analysis depth for your code reviews:

- **Instant**: Completes in about five seconds. Detects most issues and is suited for fast review and iteration cycles.
- **Deep**: Takes up to a few minutes. Conducts deeper analysis to uncover even subtle edge cases, ideal for critical code and final reviews.

!!! info "Accessing On-Demand Review"
    You can also access On-Demand Review from the **Home** and **Git** tabs. Expand the kluster.ai section if collapsed.

After the review completes, kluster.ai displays any issues found. For each issue, you have three actions:

- **Fix with AI**: Generates an AI-powered fix suggestion that you can apply with one click.
- **Snooze**: Temporarily hides the issue for a selected duration (1 day, 7 days, or 30 days). The issue reappears automatically after the snooze period expires.
- **Ignore**: Permanently dismisses the issue. It will not reappear in future reviews.

!!! tip "When to snooze vs. ignore"
    Use **Snooze** for issues you plan to address later but don't want cluttering your current review. Use **Ignore** for false positives or accepted risks that don't need further attention.

## Code block review

Select any code in your editor, right-click, and choose **Review with kluster.ai** (or press `Ctrl+Shift+K`). This is useful for:

- Verifying a specific function or block you just wrote.
- Checking code during merge conflict resolution.
- Getting a quick security check before moving on.

![Right-click to review selected code](/kluster-mkdocs/images/code-reviews/ide-reviews/human-written-code/on-demand-reviews/manual-review-this-code.webp)

!!! info "Hint button"
    When you select code, a hint button also appears next to your selection to trigger the review. This hint button is not yet available in Cursor—use the right-click menu or keyboard shortcut instead.
