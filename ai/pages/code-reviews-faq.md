# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is the difference between human-written code and AI-generated code reviews?

- **Human-written code**: Direct editor integration. You trigger reviews yourself by right-clicking code, using keyboard shortcuts, or clicking buttons in the extension sidebar. No AI assistant needed—review any code directly.
- **AI-generated code**: For AI-assisted workflows. Reviews trigger automatically when AI generates code, or when you ask your AI assistant to review existing code. Works with Claude Code, Codex CLI, Cursor, VS Code, and other AI assistants.

### I mostly write code without AI—is kluster.ai useful for me?

Yes. Human-written code reviews are built for this. Right-click any code or press `Ctrl+Shift+K` to trigger a review. No AI assistant needed. See [Human-written code reviews](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/ide-reviews/human-written-code/on-demand-reviews/) for setup.

### When should I run an on-demand review?

Run an on-demand review before pushing changes. Use **Review uncommitted changes** for staged files, or **Review all branch changes** to review all changes made since the branch was created.

### Do the two modes ever conflict or overlap?

No. AI-generated code reviews run when AI generates code. Human-written code reviews run when you trigger them. They work independently.

### What IDEs and CLI tools are supported?

- **IDE extensions**: Cursor, VS Code, Windsurf, Antigravity, JetBrains
- **CLI tools**: Claude Code, Codex CLI
- **Standalone CLI**: [kluster-cli](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/cli/quickstart/) for terminal-only workflows

See [Installation](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/get-started/installation/) for setup instructions.

### What programming languages are supported?

kluster.ai is language agnostic and can review code in any programming language, including Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, Java, Go, Rust, C++, C#, Ruby, PHP, and more.

### Can I review a full codebase?

Yes. For system-wide analysis, use [Repo Reviews](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/repo-reviews/quickstart/) to scan your entire repository and find bugs that emerge from cross-module interactions. Repo reviews are designed specifically for analyzing your complete codebase as a system.

For reviewing specific changes, use [on-demand reviews](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/ide-reviews/human-written-code/on-demand-reviews/) to check individual files, code blocks, or uncommitted changes.

### Can I use kluster.ai with any AI model?

Yes. When using an AI coding assistant, Code Reviews works with any model available in supported IDEs, including Claude, GPT, Gemini, and others.

### Can I exclude files or folders from reviews?

Currently, exclusion rules are configured at the project level through the kluster.ai platform. See [Custom Rules](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/configuration/rules/) for setting up project-specific configurations.

### How can I invite a team member?

Team management is available on Team and Enterprise plans. Log in to the [kluster.ai platform](https://platform.kluster.ai){target=\_blank} and navigate to your team settings to invite members.

### How frequently does kluster.ai update its vulnerability detection?

kluster.ai sources vulnerability data from public CVE databases that are continuously updated. Detection coverage improves as new CVEs are published and ingested, rather than following a fixed update schedule.

### How can I provide feedback about issues detected by kluster.ai?

Each time a code review is done, a feedback option is available from the extension or in the platform. Your feedback helps improve detection accuracy and reduce false positives.

### What should I do if kluster.ai flags a false positive?

In [on-demand IDE reviews](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/ide-reviews/human-written-code/on-demand-reviews/) and [repo reviews](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/repo-reviews/quickstart/), you can **Ignore** a false positive to permanently dismiss it from future reviews. If you want to revisit the issue later, use **Snooze** to temporarily hide it for 1, 7, or 30 days. Your feedback through these actions helps improve detection accuracy.

### Do kluster.ai reviews improve over time?

Yes. When you connect your GitHub repositories, kluster.ai learns rules from your repo and applies project-specific configurations. See [Custom Rules](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/configuration/rules/) for more details.

We also continuously improve our engine to perform deeper reviews, optimizing for common issues our users encounter. If you have suggestions for improvement, contact us at [support@kluster.ai](mailto:support@kluster.ai).

### What is the difference between Instant and Deep analysis for code reviews?

- **Instant**: Completes in about five seconds. Detects most issues and is suited for fast review and iteration cycles.
- **Deep**: Takes up to a few minutes. Conducts deeper analysis to uncover even subtle edge cases, ideal for critical code and final reviews.
Use **Instant** for fast iteration during development. Use **Deep** for final reviews, production code, or when thoroughness matters more than speed. You can configure the default for each workflow in [Options](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/configuration/options/#analysis-level).

## AI-generated code

### What triggers an automatic review?

For AI-generated code, reviews trigger automatically when your AI coding assistant generates or modifies code. This happens without any action from you. The code diff is sent to kluster.ai, and the results appear in your chat or terminal.

### How does AI-generated code review handle intent verification differently than human-written code review?

AI-generated code reviews see your original prompt to the AI, so they can verify the AI did what you asked—not just that the code runs. If you asked for Firebase auth but the AI used localStorage, the review catches it. Human-written code reviews cannot check intent because they only see the code, not your request. See [this example](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/ide-reviews/ai-generated-code/examples/cursor-firebase-nextjs/) for a real case.

### Does kluster.ai apply changes automatically?

No. kluster.ai identifies issues and suggests fixes, but doesn't modify your code directly. For AI-generated code, the AI assistant decides whether to apply them—in most cases, it will automatically incorporate the fixes. For human-written code, you apply fixes yourself using the **Fix with AI** button or manually. Either way, you remain in control.

### Can I disable automatic reviews temporarily?

Yes. You can disable automatic reviews from [Options](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/configuration/options/) in the kluster.ai platform. Alternatively, you can disable the kluster.ai extension in your IDE, or for CLI tools, disable the MCP server.

### Does it work with multi-file edits?

Yes. AI-generated code reviews analyze diffs across multiple files in a single review, understanding the context of changes that span your codebase.

### How does dependency checking work?

The `kluster_dependency_check` tool automatically checks packages before installation. When your AI assistant suggests adding a dependency, kluster.ai validates it for known vulnerabilities before the install command runs.

### How do I rollback changes made based on kluster.ai feedback?

The changes are made by your AI assistant, not kluster.ai itself. You can revert changes in the file using your IDE undo functionality, Git commands, or simply ask the AI assistant to revert the changes.

## Human-written code

### What is the fastest way to check code I just wrote?

Select the code, press **Ctrl+Shift+K** (or right-click → **Review with kluster.ai**). Results appear in seconds with issues and one-click fixes.

### Can I use kluster.ai for code reviews in pull requests?

Yes. Check out the PR locally and either:

1. Use **Review uncommitted changes** to scan all modifications.
2. Select specific code and review it.

### How do I trigger an on-demand review?

You can trigger an on-demand review in three ways:

1. **Right-click** selected code → **Review with kluster.ai**.
2. Use the extension sidebar. Open the **On-Demand Review** section, select a mode, and click **Instant Review** or **Deep Review**.
3. Select code and use the **hint** button. This option is not available in Cursor yet.

### Can I review code I didn't write?

Yes. On-demand reviews work on any code, including your own code, AI-generated code, or code from colleagues. This is useful for auditing existing codebases or reviewing pull requests.

### Can I review a specific code block vs whole file?

Yes. Select the code you want to review, then right-click and choose **Review with kluster.ai**. You can review anything from a single function to an entire file.

### Can I review uncommitted changes?

Yes. In the kluster.ai extension sidebar, open the **On-Demand Review** section, select **Review uncommitted changes** from the Mode dropdown, then click **Instant Review** or **Deep Review**. This reviews all staged and unstaged changes across your repository.

### What is the difference between on-demand reviews and background auto reviews?

- **On-demand reviews**: You click a button or use a shortcut to trigger a review.
- **Background auto reviews (Beta, Enterprise plan)**: Automatically review your code for issues and suggestions as you work, without requiring you to trigger anything. Enable it from the **Enabled Tools** section in [Options](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/configuration/options/).

## CLI

### Can I use kluster.ai from the command line without an IDE?

Yes. The kluster-cli tool provides full code review functionality directly from the terminal—no IDE or AI assistant needed. Install it, authenticate with your API key, and review staged changes, diffs, or individual files. See [CLI Quickstart](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/cli/quickstart/).

### How do I automate reviews in my git workflow?

Install git hooks with `kluster hooks install pre-commit|pre-push|all`. Choose `pre-commit` to review before every commit, `pre-push` to review before pushing, or `all` for both. See [Git Hooks](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/cli/git-hooks/).

### Can I use kluster-cli in CI/CD pipelines?

Yes. Use `--output json` for machine-readable output and check exit codes to fail builds on issues. Exit code `0` means no issues, `3` means high severity, and `4` means critical. See [Reference](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/cli/reference/#exit-codes) for the full table.

### Can I review files without a git repository?

Yes. Use `kluster review file <path>` to review any file, even outside a git repository. See [Review Commands](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/cli/review-commands/#review-files).

## Repo reviews

### What are repo reviews and how are they different from other review modes?

Repo reviews analyze your entire codebase as a system instead of reviewing individual changes. They find bugs that emerge from interactions across modules—issues that don't show up in PR-level reviews because they're only visible when you examine how multiple parts of your code work together.

Other review modes (on-demand and automatic) check specific changes you make. Repo reviews scan everything to catch cross-module bugs, state inconsistencies, bypassed validation checks, and system-wide problems.

### How long does a repo review take?

Depending on repository size, repo reviews take several minutes. You'll receive an email notification once the analysis completes. You can close the page and come back later—the review continues running in the background.

### Can I run repo reviews on private repositories?

Yes. Repo reviews work with both public and private repositories on GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. The connection is secure and respects your repository permissions.

### Where can I access repo reviews?

Repo reviews are available in the web dashboard at [platform.kluster.ai/repo-reviews](https://platform.kluster.ai/repo-reviews){target=\_blank} and via `kluster-cli`. After connecting your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository, you can run `kluster review repo start` to trigger analysis and `kluster review repo show` to check results from terminal. See [Repo reviews from CLI](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/cli/repo-reviews/).

### What do the Fix with AI, Snooze, and Ignore actions do?

When reviewing bugs found by kluster.ai, each issue has actions to help you manage findings:

- **Fix with AI**: Generates an AI-powered fix suggestion. In IDE on-demand reviews, the fix is applied with one click. In repo reviews, you get a prompt to paste into your AI assistant.
- **Snooze**: Temporarily hides the issue for a selected duration (1 day, 7 days, or 30 days). The issue reappears automatically after the snooze period expires. Use this for issues you plan to address later.
- **Ignore**: Permanently dismisses the issue. It will not reappear in future reviews. Use this for false positives or accepted risks.

These actions are available in [on-demand IDE reviews](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/ide-reviews/human-written-code/on-demand-reviews/) and [repo reviews](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/repo-reviews/quickstart/).
