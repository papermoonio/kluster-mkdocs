# Repo Reviews quickstart

Learn how to run system-wide codebase analysis with [kluster.ai](https://www.kluster.ai/){target=\_blank} Repo Reviews. Connect your repository, wait for the deep scan to complete, and review cross-module bugs that slip through PR-level reviews.

!!! tip "Prefer terminal workflows?"
    You can also run repo reviews from CLI with `kluster review repo start` and inspect results with `kluster review repo show`. See [Repo reviews from CLI](/kluster-mkdocs/code-reviews/cli/repo-reviews/).

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have:

- **A kluster.ai account**: Sign up on the [kluster.ai platform](https://platform.kluster.ai/signup){target=\_blank} if you don't have one.
- **A connected repository**: You'll need to connect your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository through the dashboard.

## How repo reviews work

Repo reviews analyze your entire codebase as a system instead of reviewing individual changes. When multiple parts of your code interact, issues emerge that don't show up in PR-level reviews.

1. **Connect your repository**: Link your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository to kluster.ai.
2. **Scan starts automatically**: Wait for the deep analysis to complete.
3. **Review the findings**: Examine issues grouped by severity and type.

This catches cross-module bugs, state inconsistencies, bypassed validation checks, and other system-wide problems that slip through regular code reviews.

## Running your first repo review

### 1. Connect your repository

Go to the [Repo Reviews dashboard](https://platform.kluster.ai/repo-reviews){target=\_blank} and click **Connect Repository**.

Select your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket):

![Select Git provider modal](/kluster-mkdocs/images/code-reviews/repo-reviews/repo-reviews-setup-2.webp)

Then choose the repository you want to analyze:

### 2. Scan repo

Once your repository is connected, the analysis starts automatically and shows **"Review in progress..."**. The scan runs a deep analysis of your codebase. Depending on repository size, this takes several minutes. You'll receive an email notification once it's done.

You can close the page and come back later.

### 3. Review the results

When the scan finishes, you'll see a list of issues found in your codebase:

![Repo review results showing list of issues](/kluster-mkdocs/images/code-reviews/repo-reviews/repo-reviews-setup-4.webp)

Each issue displays:

- **Description**: Summary of the problem.
- **Severity**: High, Medium, or Low (shown with color badges).
- **Type**: The category of issue (Security, Logical, Performance, Knowledge, etc.).
- **Priority**: P0-P5 ranking for triage.

### 4. Examine issue details

Click a given bug or issue to learn more. The detail view includes:

- **Description**: What the problem is.
- **Explanation**: Why this is a problem and how it impacts your system.
- **Recommended Actions**: Steps to fix the issue.

### 5. Take action

For each issue, you have four actions:

- **Copy**: Copy the issue details to share or save.
- **Fix with AI**: Get a prompt to paste into your AI assistant (Claude, Cursor, etc.) to fix it automatically.
- **Snooze**: Temporarily hides the issue for a selected duration (1 day, 7 days, or 30 days). The issue reappears automatically after the snooze period expires.
- **Ignore**: Permanently dismisses the issue. It will not reappear in future reviews.

![Take action on the bugs found by clicking one of the available actions](/kluster-mkdocs/images/code-reviews/repo-reviews/repo-reviews-setup-6.webp)

!!! tip "When to snooze vs. ignore"
    Use **Snooze** for issues you plan to address later but don't want cluttering your current review. Use **Ignore** for false positives or accepted risks that don't need further attention.
